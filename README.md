This challenge is about using the API keys fetching the data , creating a dataframe and then working on it.
I have mainly worked on the data sourced from weather api and then data is used to judge the relation between the hemisphere, latitudes, wind speed and temprature.
I have also used git ignore function in this to make sure that the api keys doesn't get uploaded while pushing the changes
